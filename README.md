# DNA Analyzer
Bespoke DNA Analysis Engine for analyzing 23andMe or Ancestry Data.

## Why I Wrote This
My family history is filled with cancer, and I plan to buck the familial trend. Having a copy of my father's ancestry.com raw data, and my own 23andMe raw data, I wanted to know more about the genetics of cancer, and, as it turns out, I'm not a geneticist, but I *can* analyze data. Taking the limited knowledge I had, I decided to write a small set of python classes that can help me to analyze the text file I got from 23andMe, and maybe make a decision regarding whether I should take the next step and get professional genetic counseling.

## Notice and Fair Warning
**This code in this repo should not be used for medical decision-making.**

I am not a doctor, nor a geneticist. There is more than a small chance that the analysis you recieve while running this codebase is wrong. I did my best, given the time I had to play with it, but frankly, I didn't spend a ton of time putting this together, so take it all with a grain of salt. Genetics is a highly complex field, and there's a reason people get PhD's in the topic.

If you have any concerns with what the application tells you, don't be dumb. Get professional genetic counseling from a CLIA-certified laboratory before doing anything else. 23andMe and Ancestry.com are not CLIA-certified, so their data isn't held to the same high standard as medical grade genetics laboratories. Also, did I mention I'm not a doctor or geneticist? Yes. Yes I did.

**I REPEAT: DO NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR MEDICAL DECISIONS BASED ON THIS CODE.**

I am not liable for any decisions you make because you found something in your ancestry.com or 23andMe data and ran it through a random programmer's code.
