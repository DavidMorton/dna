# DNA Analyzer
Bespoke DNA Analysis Engine for analyzing 23andMe or Ancestry Data.

## Why I Wrote This
My father, and many of my relatives have either had, or have died of cancer. I wanted to know more about the genetics of cancer, and I know of no other way to learn about things than to write some code about it. 

For me, I used it as the basis for my decision to get professional genetic counseling. 

## Notice
This code in this repo should not be used for medical decision-making. 

I am not a doctor, nor a geneticist. 

If you have any concern, get professional genetic counseling from a CLIA-certified laboratory. 

**I REPEAT: DO NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR MEDICAL DECISIONS BASED ON THIS CODE.**

I am not liable for any decisions you make because you found something in your ancestry.com or 23andMe data and ran it through a random programmer's code.
